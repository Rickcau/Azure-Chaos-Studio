# Azure-Chaos-Studio
The intent of this repo is to provide various artifacts that help you better understand Azure Chaos Studio and how you might go about creating and setting up Experiments in an automated manner.  I hope the tips and resources found in this repository help you onboard and deploy your experiments in Chaos Studio much faster. <br>

## Network Security Group Experiment
I have created a set of Bicep files that will allow you to quickly deployment an Experiment that leverages an NSG.  It will setup the necessary permissions for the Experiment, enable the Target and Capabilities as well.
